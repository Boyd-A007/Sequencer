# Sequencer
This is a powershell script I am designing to read an XML file and run the actions listed in the file. Included is a copy of the XML that runs Check Disk, SFC and DISM on a Windows device. This is a work in progress, contributions\suggestions are welcome//

.\Start-Sequencer.ps1 -Path <Path to XML>
